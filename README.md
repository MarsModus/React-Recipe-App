## React App for finding Recipes ##

Using Edamam's Recipe Search API, I created this simple application.

## Tech used ##
- React
- Material UI, the ingredient accordion
- Axios, for fetching data from the API

## How to use ##
- Clone this repository into a specific folder.
- Preferably go to https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api and get an ID and API key. Then, replace mine in src/App.js. I am using the developer option.
- Open terminal and type "npm start".
